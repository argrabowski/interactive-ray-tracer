# Interactive Ray Tracer

https://interactive-ray-tracer.glitch.me

## Overview
This project is a simple ray tracing WebGL application that renders scenes with spheres, planes, and lights. The scenes are defined using GLSL shaders, and users can switch between different predefined scenes by clicking buttons.

## Features
- **Ray Tracing:** Utilizes ray tracing techniques to simulate the interaction of light with spheres and planes.
- **Dynamic Scene Switching:** Users can switch between three different scenes with varying configurations by clicking buttons.
- **Shader-Based Rendering:** The rendering pipeline is implemented using GLSL shaders, including vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Reflections:** The scenes support reflections, adding realism and complexity to the rendered images.

## Controls
The application provides a simple user interface with three buttons to switch between scenes:
- **Image One Button (`imageOne`):** Renders the first predefined scene.
- **Image Two Button (`imageTwo`):** Renders the second predefined scene.
- **Image Three Button (`imageThree`):** Renders the third predefined scene.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a WebGL-compatible browser.
3. Interact with the application using the provided buttons.
